				<h2><b>Why Zig is amazing and I use it</b></h2>
				<img src="zig.png"><br><br>
				
				<p>Zig is my favourite programming language because it feels
					 fresh and not just another one of those Rust like clones. It
					 also isn't OOP like most modern programming languages
					 which is a plus as OOP is my most favourite thing. Zig is
					 an imperative programming language. Imperative programming is a programming
					 paradigm of software that uses statements
					 that change a program's state. Zig let's you put functions in structs
					 which is very nice. It also has a robust std library. It's cross-compilation
					 is really good. Zig is also a C compiler and Uber uses their C toolchain.<br>
