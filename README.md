## Opinions
<b>1 : Re-Writing everything in Rust is bad</b><br>
The reason I think this is because Rust is still a fairly new programming language<br>
and this could imply that libraries are not yet mature compared to something like C or C++.<br>
Also just because it's memory safe doesn't mean we should re-write everything in it.<br>
Finally, Rust is great but I don't think we can truly adopt Rust a very major programming language<br>
like C, C++ or JavaScript until the industry starts supporting it.<br>
<br>

<b>2 : Go is the new C and Rust is the new C++</b><br>
The reason I think Go is the new C is because it's made by a co-founder of C (Ken Thompson)<br>
which will have influenced the syntax of it and it doesn't have bloated libraries<br>
because Go libraries are very simple and easy to use, it also makes the user manually<br>
(like C with no try and catch) error handle for the most part by doing:
```
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal()
} else {
    return 0
}
```
The reason I think Rust is the new C++ is because of it's syntax. The syntax plays a<br>
big part in why Rust is so unique and different but it definately has some ties to C++<br>
and it's libraries too are sort of similar in how they work to C++.<br>
<br>

<b>3 : C# has defeated Java</b><br>
The reason I think this is because Java has been on the decline for many years now<br>
while C# has been on the incline. Although C# is mainly for Windows I think that gives it an<br>
advantage because it means that it will be faster than Java which would entise programmers<br>
into writing in it. Java is also quite bloated and it's the same with the code<br>
